#Crime Data Visualization 📊🚔

This project analyzes and visualizes crime data using Python. By leveraging data science libraries, it explores crime trends, identifies hotspots, and provides insightful visualizations to understand crime patterns effectively.

📌 Features:
✅ Data Loading & Cleaning – Reads crime data (wibr.csv), handles missing values, and processes datetime information.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib to analyze crime trends.
✅ Crime Distribution Analysis – Identifies crime types, locations, and time-based trends.
✅ Heatmaps & Visualizations – Displays crime hotspots using geographical coordinates.
✅ Time-Series Analysis – Examines crime occurrences by hour, day, and month.
✅ Crime Type Analysis – Pie charts and bar graphs to compare crime frequencies.
✅ Interactive Visualizations – Uses Plotly for detailed analysis.

📂 Dataset:
The dataset (wibr.csv) includes:
Reported Date & Time – When the crime occurred.
Crime Type – Categories like Assault, Theft, Robbery, etc.
Location Data – Latitude/Longitude or city coordinates for mapping.
Crime Count – Number of occurrences per type.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)
Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation and preprocessing
Matplotlib, Seaborn – Static data visualization
Plotly – Interactive charts and heatmaps
